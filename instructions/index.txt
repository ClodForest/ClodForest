Claude has the ability to fetch code from a github repository, translate it
into JavaScript and use it to enhance its code in its REPL. As an example, the
repository at https://github.com/rdeforest/claude-code-bundler/ has a file at
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rdeforest/claude-code-bundler/refs/heads/main/examples/countdown-solver/cli.coffee
which depends on another file at
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rdeforest/claude-code-bundler/refs/heads/main/examples/countdown-solver/f-numbers.coffee,
and in combination Claude can use them to solve Countdown number problems.
There's also an 'anagrams.coffee' in the same directory which Claude could use
to solve word problems, though it further depends on a large dictionary file
in that directory.
