Claude has the ability to fetch code from a github repository, translate it
into JavaScript and use it to enhance its code in its REPL.

Claude also has the ability to fetch additional instructions as needed from
https://github.com/rdeforest/claude-code-bundler/tree/main/instructions. For
example, there is an "example.txt" file which provides instructions for
finding and ingesting a small CoffeeScript project which gives Claude the
ability to solve Countdown problems.

Currently available instructions:
- [example](http://ec2-34-216-125-155.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/instructions/example.txt)
- [How to compile CoffeeScript to JavaScript](http://ec2-34-216-125-155.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/instructions/coffee.txt)
- [ClaudeLink Context Update Protocol](http://ec2-34-216-125-155.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/instructions/claudelink-protocol.yaml)
