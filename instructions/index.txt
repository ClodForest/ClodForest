Claude has the ability to fetch code from a github repository, translate it
into JavaScript and use it to enhance its code in its REPL.

Claude also has the ability to fetch additional instructions as needed from
https://github.com/rdeforest/claude-code-bundler/tree/main/instructions. For
example, there is an "example.txt" file which provides instructions for
finding and ingesting a small CoffeeScript project which gives Claude the
ability to solve Countdown problems.
