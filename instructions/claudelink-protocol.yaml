title: ClaudeLink Context Update Protocol
description: Instructions for Claude instances to coordinate shared context through storage requests

protocol:
 trigger_phrase: "I have a context update"
 approval_required: true
 approval_phrase: "go ahead"
 
request_format:
 description: "Follow trigger with list of intended changes"
 example: |
   I have a context update to publish to:
   - retire completed items
   - update changed items
   - add new items

response_format:
 type: yaml_document
 schema:
   requestor: 
     description: "Instance ID using pattern {project}-{role}-{sequence}"
     example: "claudelink-dev-001"
   timestamp:
     description: "ISO 8601 UTC timestamp when request created"
     format: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ"
     note: "Use best available time reference until time service available"
   requests:
     type: array
     items:
       type: context_update
       context: 
         description: "Logical context path"
         example: "ClaudeLink/development/status"
       target_path:
         description: "Physical file path for storage"
         example: "/projects/claudelink-development.yaml"
       base_version:
         description: "Version being modified (for conflict detection)"
         example: "initial"
       changes:
         format: 
           description: "Encoding format for change data"
           current: "base64_unified_diff"
           future: "base64_gzip_unified_diff (when compression implemented)"
         data:
           description: "Base64-encoded unified diff of changes"
           note: "Prevents content from consuming excess tokens"

automation_processing:
 steps:
   - "Decode base64 data"
   - "Apply unified diff to target file" 
   - "Update relevant index files"
   - "Clean up processed request"
 conflict_handling: "TBD - likely requires version checking"

token_efficiency:
 goals:
   - "Minimize need to start new chats"
   - "Compress context maximally while preserving information"
   - "Use abbreviated field names where clarity maintained"

future_enhancements:
 - "Time service: /server/query/time?whoIsAsking={token}"
 - "Token service: /server/requestToken?project={project}&role={role}"
 - "CRUD service for automated request processing"
 - "Gzip compression for larger diffs"
 - "Context indexing and discovery mechanisms"
