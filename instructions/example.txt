The repository at https://github.com/rdeforest/claude-code-bundler/

has a file at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rdeforest/claude-code-bundler/refs/heads/main/examples/countdown-solver/cli.coffee

which depends on another file at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rdeforest/claude-code-bundler/refs/heads/main/examples/countdown-solver/f-numbers.coffee,

and in combination, Claude can use them to solve Countdown number problems.

There's also an 'anagrams.coffee' in the same directory which Claude could use
to solve word problems, though it further depends on a large dictionary file
in that directory.
