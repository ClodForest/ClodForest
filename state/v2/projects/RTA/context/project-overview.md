# RTA Project: Ready To Archive

**Purpose:** Develop systematic workflows for extracting value from conversations and organizing knowledge for future reference.

## Project Goals

1. **Conversation Archiving:** Create efficient processes for summarizing and storing valuable interactions
2. **Knowledge Organization:** Build searchable, usable information architecture from chat history
3. **Collaboration Optimization:** Identify and replicate successful human-AI interaction patterns
4. **Performance Measurement:** Develop metrics for evaluating collaboration effectiveness
5. **Template Development:** Create reusable project bootstrap materials

## Current Status

**Phase 1: Foundation** ‚úÖ Complete
- Designed v2 directory structure based on usage patterns
- Created RTA project as proof-of-concept
- Established decision documentation process

**Phase 2: Migration** üîÑ In Progress
- Gradually moving content from v1/ to v2/
- Processing [RTA] tagged conversations one by one
- Extracting collaboration patterns and preferences

**Phase 3: Optimization** ‚è≥ Planned
- Build project template system
- Develop performance metrics
- Create bootstrap materials for new projects

## Key Principles

- **Usage-based organization:** Structure information by how it's accessed, not just content type
- **Risk reduction:** Incremental migration to avoid data loss
- **Self-documentation:** Every decision and pattern gets recorded
- **Measurable improvement:** Track collaboration effectiveness over time

## Tools & Processes

- **Chat search:** Semantic search across conversation history
- **Structured archiving:** Consistent format for conversation summaries
- **Decision tracking:** Numbered decisions with rationale and outcomes
- **Pattern documentation:** Successful workflows and anti-patterns
