# Power Management Monitoring & Optimization

**Status:** Ongoing Monitoring  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Created:** 2025-07-28  

## Description
Long-term monitoring and optimization of power management settings following the nuclear disabling approach to fix ethernet stability issues.

## Current Configuration âœ…
### BIOS Settings Applied
- **Native ASPM:** Disabled
- **CPU PCIE ASPM Mode Control:** Disabled  
- **Global C-state Control:** Disabled
- **Restore AC Power Loss:** Last State (for server operation)
- **RGB Lighting:** Stealth Mode

### Kernel Parameters Active
```
pcie_port_pm=off pcie_aspm.policy=performance
```

## Monitoring Tasks
- [ ] **Weekly stability checks:** Verify ethernet remains stable
- [ ] **Power consumption monitoring:** Measure impact of disabled power management
- [ ] **Temperature monitoring:** Ensure adequate cooling with power management disabled
- [ ] **Performance verification:** Confirm no negative impact on system performance

## Future Optimization Opportunities
- [ ] **Selective re-enablement:** Test gradual re-enabling of specific power features
- [ ] **BIOS updates:** Monitor for firmware updates that might improve ASPM compatibility
- [ ] **Driver updates:** Track Intel igc driver improvements for ASPM compatibility
- [ ] **Kernel updates:** Monitor Linux kernel improvements for PCIe power management

## Success Metrics
- **Ethernet stability:** Zero "PCIe link lost" errors
- **System uptime:** Stable 24/7 operation
- **Performance:** No degradation in system responsiveness
- **Temperature:** Normal operating temperatures maintained

## Risk Assessment
- **Power consumption:** Increased due to disabled power saving
- **Heat generation:** Potentially higher with no CPU C-states
- **Component longevity:** Monitor for any impacts from always-on operation

## Long-term Strategy
Consider this a "stable foundation" approach - prioritize reliability over power efficiency for server operation. Future optimizations should be tested carefully to avoid regression of ethernet stability.
