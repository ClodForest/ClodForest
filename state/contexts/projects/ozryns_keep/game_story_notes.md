# Cathedral Combat - Game Story & Character Notes
*Session Date: 2025-06-04*
*Campaign: Ozryn's Keep D&D*

## Major Story Developments

### The Cathedral Assault
**Setting**: Cathedral basement ritual chamber with sarcophagi and central obelisk  
**Situation**: Party tracking Tasha, instead found "Fates" attacking cathedral and capturing head priestess  
**Guards**: Found dead, strewn about - this was a full assault, not stealth infiltration  

### The Priestess Revelation
**Key Quote**: "She helped Tasha with something" but claims she's "still good"  
**Impact on Sveldolos**: Confusion and annoyance - challenges his trauma narrative about Tasha's betrayal  
**Strategic Implications**: Questions whether rescue mission interferes with Tasha's actual plan  
**Worthiness Test Theory**: This encounter increasingly likely to be orchestrated challenge  

### Erinyes (The "Fates") Encounter
**True Identity**: Fallen angels, not random attackers  
**Tactical Approach**: Coordinated assault with aerial superiority and extraction portal  
**Negotiation Attempt**: "We have no quarrel with you, let us take this one"  
**Portal Method**: Swirling dimensional gateway for priestess extraction  
**Secret Communication**: Telepathic message to Oralie (content unknown, left her shocked silent)  

### Session Climax: The Ultimatum
**Sveldolos's Declaration**: "No escape for anybody! Only talk. And death."  
**Portal Destruction**: 6th level Dispel Magic successfully eliminates extraction route  
**Current Status**: Erinyes trapped on material plane, forced negotiation or combat

### Oralie (Gwendolyn's PC)
**Communication Specialist**: Tongues spell for diplomatic opening with extraplanars  
**Divine Authority**: Cleric/Warlock combination provides otherworldly negotiation credibility

**Combat Efficiency**: Devastating damage output against both devils and fallen angels

**Treasure Hunter**: Living embodiment of "flying blender with daggers" archetype  

### León (Andrés's PC)

**Wild Magic Luck**: Bonus action spells for one minute (limited by 5e 2024 rules)  
**Positioning Discipline**: Rabbit Hop mobility keeping sorcerer out of danger zones  
**Quiet Effectiveness**: ESL player letting magic do the talking with devastating results  

## Campaign Lore & Continuity

**Resurrection Method**: Cultists perform rituals to restore statue to active form  
**Party Goal**: Work with Tasha to destroy him permanently  
**Weapon Connection**: Claws of Rhogar from his descendant, used by Honey as trophy weapon  

### Tasha's Mystery
**Staged Death**: Previously faked death, causing Sveldolos abandonment trauma  
**Current Plan**: Unknown, but priestess claims involvement while maintaining moral standing  
**Worthiness Testing**: Cathedral assault likely orchestrated challenge for party  
**Relationship**: Raised Sveldolos, complex mentor/parental figure with secretive methods  

### Combat Mechanics & Style

**Table Culture**: Detailed tactical discussions, rules expertise, collaborative problem-solving  
**Pacing**: ~1 hour real-time per combat round due to complexity and player engagement
