# Libertas Desktop Server Issues

## Current Issues

* Need to make sure I have adequate heat monitoring
* Motherboard audio not working. Devices show up but speaker test interface doesn't show up when they're selected
* Lost ethernet interface inexplicably, had to reboot. Looked like some related messages showed up in kern.log.
* When windows are full-screen and my focus-follows-mouse activates them, they get auto-raised. Normal windows, even maximized ones, correctly remain un-raised.
* Need to make SSH tunnels to AWS VM 'vault3' persist across reboots
