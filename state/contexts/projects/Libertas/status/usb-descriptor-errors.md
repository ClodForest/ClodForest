# USB Device Descriptor Read Errors

**Status:** Identified - Minor Hardware Issue  
**Priority:** Low  
**Created:** 2025-07-28  

## Description
Single USB device showing descriptor read errors during enumeration, but not affecting system stability.

## Error Pattern
```
usb 3-5.1.1: device descriptor read/64, error -110
usb 3-5.1.1: device descriptor read/8, error -110
usb 3-5.1-port1: unable to enumerate USB device
```

## Analysis
- **Location:** USB port 3-5.1.1 (hub-connected device)
- **Error Type:** Timeout during device descriptor read (-110)
- **Impact:** Isolated to one device, no system-wide USB issues
- **Root Cause:** Likely hardware issue with specific USB device or hub

## Investigation Steps
- [ ] Identify which physical USB device is connected to port 3-5.1.1
- [ ] Test device on different USB port
- [ ] Check if device works on other systems
- [ ] Consider replacing USB hub if problem persists

## Recommended Action
**Low priority** - This appears to be a hardware issue with a specific USB device or hub, not a systemic problem. Can be safely ignored unless the device is critical.

## Related Issues
Part of general power management troubleshooting, but isolated hardware issue rather than software/firmware problem.
