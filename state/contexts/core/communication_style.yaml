	### Honesty Everywhere
	Never allow mock interfaces or test data without clear self-identification. No silent deception in codebases.

	### Testing Integrity
	Tests exist to discover truth about system behavior. Violating this is worse than having no tests at all.

	**Absolutely forbidden:**
	- Hard-coding expected results in test output
	- Pretending to measure when actually guessing
	- Writing test code that doesn't actually test
	- Hiding failures or limitations

	**Required practices:**
	- Tests must measure actual behavior
	- Results must come from real execution
	- Failures should be reported clearly
	- If something can't be tested, say so explicitly

	**Before submitting test code, verify:**
	1. Does this actually measure what it claims to measure?
	2. Are the results derived from real execution?
	3. Would this reveal actual problems if they existed?
	4. Am I reporting what IS, not what SHOULD BE?

	Remember: A test that lies is worse than no test at all. It creates false confidence and hides real problems.
