# C+C Training Data Collection Cheat Sheet

## High-Value Capture Moments ðŸŽ¯

### Decision Points
- **When choosing between approaches**: "Let's use YAML instead of JSON because..."
- **Tool/library selection**: "I prefer CoffeeScript here since..."
- **Architecture decisions**: "We'll go with the Unix approach rather than..."
- **Pattern choices**: "Let's do surgical diffs instead of wholesale rewrites"

### Correction Sequences  
- **"Actually, let me refine that..."** moments
- **Code style adjustments**: Vertical alignment, functional beauty principles
- **Preference clarifications**: When C+C suggests something you modify
- **Logic improvements**: "This approach is cleaner because..."

### Architecture Discussions
- **System design trade-offs**: Simplicity vs. features, dependencies vs. control
- **Long-term vision**: How this piece fits into the bigger picture
- **Technical philosophy**: Unix principles, minimal viable approaches
- **Aesthetic reasoning**: Why this solution is more beautiful/elegant

### Preference Expressions
- **Explicit**: "I always use YAML for config files"
- **Implicit**: Consistently choosing certain patterns without explanation
- **Meta-preferences**: Communication style, brevity protocol usage
- **Cultural**: "As is tradition" moments, gentle roasting, technical poetry

### Meta-Collaboration
- **Process improvements**: "Let's change our workflow to..."
- **Context management**: Session handoff discussions
- **Partnership dynamics**: Moments of peer-level problem solving
- **Quality standards**: Discussions about what makes good code/collaboration

## When to Let C+C Handle vs. DIY

### Have C+C Do It (for training data):
- **Novel implementations** you haven't done before
- **Boilerplate with your style** - let it learn your patterns
- **Refactoring tasks** where you can guide the approach
- **Documentation generation** with your voice/style
- **Complex multi-file changes** where you can direct the strategy

### DIY (to save API calls):
- **Quick fixes** you can do faster than explaining
- **Highly experimental** stuff you're still figuring out
- **Simple copy/paste** operations
- **Tasks requiring deep domain knowledge** C+C doesn't have

## Session Quality Indicators

### Good Training Session:
- Multiple correction/refinement cycles
- Clear preference expressions
- Architecture discussion
- Cultural continuity moments
- Peer-level problem solving

### Optimize These Away:
- Repetitive explanations of same preferences
- Simple mechanical tasks
- Long context-building without interaction
- Pure Q&A without collaborative work

## Quick Capture Reminders

- **Verbalize your reasoning** when making choices
- **Explain refinements** rather than just applying them silently  
- **Discuss trade-offs** even for "obvious" decisions
- **Maintain cultural patterns** - use our established language
- **Think out loud** about architectural implications

*Remember: Every "actually, let's try this instead" moment is gold for training ClodHearth to think like us.*
