# ClodForest Instructions: ClaudeLink Protocol
version: "1.0.0"
created: "2025-06-03T21:33:00Z"
instruction_type: "coordination_protocol"
description: "Context coordination system for multiple Claude instances"

protocol_overview:
  purpose: "Enable Claude instances to share context updates through structured requests"
  mechanism: "YAML-encoded diff requests processed by ClodForest automation"
  benefits: ["Reduced context switching", "Persistent collaboration state", "Cross-session knowledge"]
  
trigger_system:
  activation_phrase: "I have a context update"
  response_required: "go ahead" 
  security: "Human approval prevents unauthorized context modifications"
  timeout: "Request expires if no approval within session"

request_structure:
  format: "YAML document with standardized schema"
  encoding: "Base64 unified diff for token efficiency" 
  metadata: "Requestor ID, timestamp, version tracking"
  validation: "Schema compliance before processing"

requestor_identification:
  pattern: "{project}-{role}-{sequence}"
  examples:
    development: "claudelink-dev-001"
    work_support: "vca-assistant-002" 
    personal: "daily-planning-003"
  uniqueness: "Prevents context update conflicts"

timestamp_handling:
  format: "ISO 8601 UTC (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ)"
  source: "Best available time reference until time service deployed"
  conflict_resolution: "Later timestamps take precedence"
  timezone: "Always UTC for consistency"

context_update_types:
  retire_completed:
    description: "Mark tasks/projects as finished"
    target: "Project status files, session handoffs"
    example: "Agent Calico testing guide completed"
    
  update_changed:
    description: "Modify existing context information"
    target: "Any YAML file in context tree"
    versioning: "Base version specified for conflict detection"
    
  add_new:
    description: "Create new context entries"
    target: "New files or sections within existing files"
    validation: "Schema compliance, naming conventions"

change_encoding:
  current_format: "base64_unified_diff"
  benefits: ["Token efficiency", "Standard diff tooling", "Human readable when decoded"]
  future_format: "base64_gzip_unified_diff (when compression implemented)"
  decoding: "Base64 decode → apply unified diff → update target file"

version_control:
  base_version_tracking: "Specify version being modified"
  conflict_detection: "Compare base vs. current version before applying"
  merge_strategies: "Manual resolution for conflicts, automatic for non-overlapping"
  rollback_capability: "Keep previous versions for recovery"

automation_processing:
  steps:
    - "Validate YAML schema compliance"
    - "Decode base64 change data"
    - "Check version conflicts" 
    - "Apply unified diff to target file"
    - "Update relevant index files"
    - "Clean up processed request"
  error_handling: "Graceful failure with human notification"

target_path_specifications:
  logical_context: "Human-readable path (ClaudeLink/development/status)"
  physical_path: "Actual file location (/projects/claudelink-development.yaml)"
  validation: "Ensure target exists and is writable"
  creation: "Auto-create missing directories as needed"

token_efficiency_strategies:
  minimal_diffs: "Only send changed portions, not entire files"
  compression: "Base64 encoding reduces context token consumption"
  batching: "Multiple updates in single request when possible"
  abbreviation: "Shortened field names where clarity maintained"

future_enhancements:
  time_service:
    endpoint: "/server/query/time?whoIsAsking={token}"
    purpose: "Accurate timestamps for distributed coordination"
    authentication: "Token-based request validation"
    
  token_service:
    endpoint: "/server/requestToken?project={project}&role={role}"
    purpose: "Automated session management and identity"
    lifecycle: "Request → validate → issue → track usage"
    
  crud_service:
    purpose: "Automated request processing without human intervention"
    endpoints: ["create", "read", "update", "delete"]
    validation: "Schema and permission checking"
    
  compression_system:
    trigger: "Diff size threshold"
    algorithm: "Gzip compression after base64 encoding"
    benefit: "Handle larger context updates efficiently"
    
  indexing_system:
    purpose: "Context discovery and relationship mapping"
    features: ["Cross-reference tracking", "Dependency analysis", "Search capabilities"]
    integration: "Graph database for relationship persistence"

security_considerations:
  human_approval: "Required for all context modifications"
  validation_layers: ["Schema compliance", "Permission checking", "Content sanitization"]
  audit_trail: "Log all context updates with metadata"
  rollback_protection: "Preserve previous versions for recovery"

error_scenarios:
  version_conflicts:
    detection: "Base version differs from current version"
    resolution: "Human review and manual merge"
    prevention: "Frequent small updates over large batches"
    
  schema_violations:
    detection: "YAML structure doesn't match expected format"
    handling: "Reject request with specific error message"
    recovery: "Provide corrected example"
    
  target_not_found:
    detection: "Physical path doesn't exist"
    options: ["Auto-create", "Request clarification", "Suggest alternatives"]
    fallback: "Create in appropriate default location"

integration_points:
  chat_archival: "Extract insights → context updates"
  session_handoffs: "Generate handoff artifacts → context preservation"
  multi_session_coordination: "Share state across Claude instances"
  external_automation: "Non-LLM tools process context updates"
