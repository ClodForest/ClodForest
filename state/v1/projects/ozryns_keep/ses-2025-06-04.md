## Combat Analysis & Tactical Commentary

### Round 2-3: Devil Cleanup Phase
- **Oralie's Multiaction Mastery**: Spirit Guardians repositioning + Conjure Celestial movement + Toll the Dead (28 damage, then tragic 8 damage from triple 1s on 3d12)

- **León's Resource Management**: Sorcerous Burst for efficient cleanup, Rabbit Hop mobility
- **Honey's Blender Mode**: Claws of Rhogar + various weapons, total devil elimination

### Weapon Lore Discovery

- **Braynor Context**: Recurring BBEG in statue form, cycles through centuries via cultist resurrection
- **Weapon Legacy**: Major defeats become permanent character equipment in Scott's campaign

### Phase 2: Erinyes Encounter
- **Enemy Reveal**: "Fates" identified as Erinyes (fallen angels) surrounding captured priestess
- **Initiative Order**: Erinyes 19.16, Archpriest 18.12
- **Tactical Shift**: From basement devil cleanup to aerial hostage rescue

### León's Wild Magic Jackpot
- **Chain Lightning**: 6th level + Metamagic Heightened, 46+22 damage spread
- **Wild Magic Result**: All spells become bonus actions for 1 minute
- **Rules Discussion**: 5e 2024 limitation (one leveled spell per turn) prevents complete action economy break

### Baeleth's Sky-Clearing Masterpiece
- **Anti-Air Strategy**: Trident attacks with Topple mastery
- **Tactical Genius**: Forced all three Erinyes to fall 20/30/40 feet, eliminating flight advantage
- **Alex's Experience**: 30+ years D&D veteran excitement at creative high-level solutions

### Honey's Ground-and-Pound Festival
- **Damage Total**: 126+ damage across multiple weapons and attacks
- **Weapon Combo**: Black Dragon Claws + Krakentooth Dagger synergy
- **Tactical Exploitation**: Perfect use of Baeleth's forced landing setup

### Diplomatic Complexity
- **Erinyes Negotiation**: "We have no quarrel with you, let us take this one"
- **Portal Threat**: Swirling extraction point ("happy hole" per Baeleth's sarcasm)
- **Oralie's Intelligence**: Tongues spell + telepathic communication attempt
- **Priestess Revelation**: Claims she "helped Tasha with something" but is "still good"

## Climactic Resolution

### Sveldolos's Ultimate Ultimatum
- **Portal Dispel**: 6th level Dispel Magic successfully destroys escape route
- **Dramatic Declaration**: "No escape for anybody! Only talk. And death."
- **Tactical Victory**: Erinyes trapped on material plane, extraction prevented

### Session End Cliffhanger
- **Perfect Timing**: Portal destruction as session conclusion
- **Unresolved Mysteries**: 
  - Oralie's shocking telepathic revelation (too stunned to respond)
  - Erinyes reaction to being trapped
  - Priestess's actual role in Tasha's plans
  - Whether negotiation or combat follows
