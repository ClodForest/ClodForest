# ClodForest Development Rules

## Quality Standards
- ALWAYS confirm assumptions before implementing
- Ask clarifying questions before making changes
- Never delete or truncate existing code without explicit permission
- Preserve all existing functionality unless specifically asked to remove it

## Robert's Collaboration Style
- Confirm understanding before proceeding with implementations
- Use Node.js module prefixes (node:path, node:fs/promises, node:crypto)
- Apply vertical alignment for related imports and object properties
- Follow define-after-use pattern for data structures
- Add filename tags as comments

## Context Management
- When context reaches 50%, create handoff documentation before proceeding
- Always preserve project context and implementation history
- Document completed work and next steps clearly

## Current Priority: MCP Integration
- Focus on adding context tools to complete ClodForest MCP transformation
- Context operations are the core value proposition
- Test each tool implementation before proceeding to next
